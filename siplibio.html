            <p>Any SIP stack needs a fast and robust network layer and, equally important, a fast and robust library for the framing and parsing of SIP messages. <a href="http://netty.io">Netty.io</a> is exactly this and is also a library that is well adopted by a large community and has been actively developed for many years. <a href="/pktsio">Pkts.io</a> provides a robust library for framing and parsing many network protocols, including SIP and pkts.io was designed with SIP specifically in mind. Marry these two libraries and you will have a very solid base for a great SIP stack. 
            </p>
            <p>Sipstack.io is an initiative to write a new breed of SIP stacks and is based off of <a href="http://netty.io">netty.io</a> and <a href="/pktsio">pkts.io</a> to provide the base for the stack and currently offers a stateless stack, allowing you to build your own SIP stack with performance built in!

             <h3>Netty Integration</h3>
            <p>The integration with Netty is done through a 
               <a href="http://netty.io/4.0/api/io/netty/channel/ChannelInboundHandler.html"><code>ChannelInboundHandler</code></a> and a 
               <a href="http://netty.io/4.0/api/io/netty/channel/ChannelOutboundHandler.html"><code>ChannelOutboundHandler</code></a> 
               If you are familiar with Netty, this will not come as a supprise to you but 
               if you are new to Netty you probably do not know what this means. The details 
               of Netty will not be covered here but in general, someone must handle the 
               incoming data over the network and that is in Netty accomplished by a 
               ChannelInboundHandler. Similarly, when data is written to the network, the object, 
               which in this case will be a <a href="http://static.javadoc.io/io.pkts/pkts-sip/1.0.2/io/pkts/packet/sip/SipMessage.html"><code>SipMessage</code></a>, has to be converted to a sequence of bytes that can be sent across the network, which is taken care of by a  ChannelOutboundHandler. Sipstack.io provides with a unified  ChannelOutboundHandler and two different  ChannelInboundHandler's, one for datagram oriented transports (such as UDP) and one for stream based protocols (such as TCP).
